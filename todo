Implement nicer UX for page transitions on client side
  - use approach like https://github.com/Zip753/nuxt-spa-proof-of-concept/blob/master/pages/spa.vue /
    https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/2568
  - add skeleton UI https://github.com/egoist/vue-content-loader
Do we need a sitemap.xml or robots.txt?
Add 'rollbar_env' param, or similar, that we can use to both pass to rollbar and display the 'test env' toolbar chip
